## Project Conventions

- You must use either MVVM or MVC architecture.
- You must use RxSwift for you MVVM interactions.
- You must layout UI in code, using a DSL language consistent with the project.
- You must make sure that UI changes support both light and dark interface styles. 
- You must not change default configurations for Swiftlint/Swiftgen.
- All resources(localized strings, images, colors and other types) should be stored inside `/Support/Resources`.
- You may use comments to give an exaplantion on a complicated code. If you do, comments should be succint and on point.
