## Project Conventions

- You must use either MVVM or MVC architecture.
- You must use RxSwift for your MVVM interactions.
- You must use FlowCoordinator pattern for navigation logic.
- You must layout UI in code, using a DSL language consistent with the project.
- You must make sure that UI changes support both light and dark interface styles. 

- You must use Swiftlint and Swiftgen.
- You must not change default project configurations for Swiftlint/Swiftgen.
- All resources(localized strings, images, colors and other types) should be stored inside `/Support/Resources`.
- You may use comments to provide exaplantions on complicated pieces of code. If you do, the comments should be succint and on point.
